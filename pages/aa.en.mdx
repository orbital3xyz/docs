# The **real** account abstraction

**Orbital uses a hybrid hosting model to provide convenience and security with four account types that are currently supported**

* Classic: Compatible with existing account systems, fully controlled by the user, supports import of existing accounts.
* Custodial: Use Orbital3's key escrow service to get a simpler user experience.
* Safe: Support both hosted, federated, and assisted management modes for security and ease of use.
* Shared: Organization-oriented account type, including team collaboration, role decentralization, risk control and other features.

**Classic accounts vs. hosted accounts vs. safe accounts vs. shared accounts**
