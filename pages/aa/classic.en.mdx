# Classic Account

Classic accounts are the most widely used account system available, built with self-hosted and single-signature, supporting import and export, and with the widest ecological support.

There is no creation cost and it is compatible with other existing wallet products. Classic accounts are the best choice for users who have a need to use a large number of sub-accounts.
