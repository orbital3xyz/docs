# Orbital3
 
Orbital3 provides a seamless web3 wallet for users to access the blockchain network and a robust web3 infrastructure stack for developers to easily build web3 apps and games.

Break the impossible triangle dilemma (decentralization, security and scalability) by simplifying the access barrier for developers and users from web2 through escrow accounts and partial keys, and providing more sophisticated capabilities that web3 itself does not have.

Orbital3 is designed as a modular web3 system with a focus on open standards, compatibility and interoperability of developer tools. With Orbital3, you can use just one of the modules, or you can use the entire stack. Likewise, you are free to combine Orbital3 with your favorite developer tools. This fits the "web3" profile - open standards and compatibility :)
