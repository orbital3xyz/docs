# Build a user-friendly account system

Based on Orbital3's flexible architecture, we have built an extremely user-friendly, key-free, fee-free wallet integration solution tailored to our users.

## Email Login

Users use email to register and log in to their accounts without touching the mnemonic, private key.

## Keyless account creation

When users first sign up, they are less concerned about security because they don't have anything in their wallet. At this stage, we can help users create a secure account in escrow mode. After users have accumulated more assets in their wallets and have a better understanding of how the blockchain works, they can then upgrade the escrow model to a co-escrow or assisted escrow model.

## Provide users with fee waivers

Join Orbital3's Relay Service and offer your users.
- For new users, offer a certain amount of fee reduction.
- Set up a whitelist of contract interactions and provide users with fee reductions when they interact with specific contracts within the whitelist.
- Provide users with the option to use project tokens to pay for processing fees.
