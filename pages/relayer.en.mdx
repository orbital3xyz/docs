#### For EVM compatible chains, Orbital3 uses smart contracts as the account model and unlocks the following capabilities

- Gas abstraction: Users can pay for network Gas via various tokens (i.e. USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Fee payment in lieu: The project owner can provide users with fee waivers to lower the threshold of use
- Transaction Batching: Combine multiple independent transactions and allow them to be executed in a single transaction, guaranteeing transactional nature
